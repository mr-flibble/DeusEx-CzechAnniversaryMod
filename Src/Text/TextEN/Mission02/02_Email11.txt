<P>
<P>>This is a hard stretch but we'll pull through all right, and we'll
<P>>help a lot of people who wouldn't be helped otherwise.  I've got a
<P>>lot of faith in you and the rest of the staff.  We'll make do.
<P>
<P>And we've got faith in you -- there aren't really any apologies needed.  None of us would be here if we didn't believe in what we're doing.
<P>
<P>Don't worry so much about us, and remember to take care of yourself,
<P>
