<P>We've had several attempts to hack into the main Daedalus system, mostly amateur tunneling stunts that don't require a prejudicial response; however, in keeping with standard protocols, all Level 1 lock system codes have been changed.  The new code is 2167.  This will work within the complex, but isn't valid for exterior access (those systems are on a separate grid, as is the armory).  Pass this code on to those with the proper clearances.
