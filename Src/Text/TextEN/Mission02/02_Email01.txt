<P>
<P>I left a message on your machine but wanted to follow up.  With both of us traveling it's hard to get together, isn't it?  I miss you so much.  I'll make it up to you when I get back.  Oh, wait, your brother's staying with you, isn't he?  Well, just wait until you're alone.  We'll work things out. Promise.
<P>
<P>Kisses.
