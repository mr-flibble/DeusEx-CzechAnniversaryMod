<P>Thomas,

<P>Another week, another report.  The triage situation here is getting tight -- so many people with the Gray Death, and we simply can't help them.  At best, we give them fluids and attempt to keep them hydrated until they crash-out, but that's just taking up space we could use for someone treatable.  A lot of them have nowhere to go, no... social support, and they're creating problems in the clinic -- security is virtually non-existant and a few times I've had to tranq someone and drag them back out onto the street. 
<P>
<P>Secondary diseases on the rise: lots of tetanus, gangrene, resistant infections, advanced flu, that sort of thing. I've attached a detailed spreadsheet with a break down and supply req.  That's another thing: we missed last week's supply shipment, and we're getting low on
<P>
<P>Christ, I think they're shooting outside. I've got to go. Do what you can and let me know what to expect.
<P>
<P>Allred
