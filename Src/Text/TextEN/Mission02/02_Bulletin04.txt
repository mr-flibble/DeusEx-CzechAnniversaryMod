<P><B>Be Safe: Be Suspicious</B>
<P>
<P>Terrorism has become an unfortunate fact of life not only in New York but the country at large, a direct assault on our communities and our way of life that leaves citizens struggling to find answers to difficult questions, not the least of which is "What can I do to prevent such atrocities? How can I help?"
<P>
<P>Quite simply, terrorism is successful because terrorists are able to pass unnoticed and unremarked upon -- but they fail to count on the best intelligence network ever devised: the American people.  How can you tell who might be a terrorist?  Look for the following characteristics:
<P>
<P>* A stranger or foreigner.
<P>* Argumentative, especially about politics or philosophy.
<P>* Probing questions about your work, particularly high-tech.
<P>* Spends a greater than average amount of time on the Net.
<P>* Interests in chemistry, electronics, or computers.
<P>* Large numbers of mail-order deliveries.
<P>* Taking photographs of major landmarks.
<P>
<P>And those are just a few.  If you're suspicious, then turn them in to your local law enforcement for a thorough background check.  Better safe than sorry.  You and your neighbors will sleep more securely knowing that you're watching each other's back.
