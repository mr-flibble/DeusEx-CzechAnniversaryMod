<P><B>Brooklyn Naval Yards Completes Sub Pen</B>
<P>
<P>In a ceremony held earlier today, the venerable Brooklyn Naval Yards christened a new, state-of-the-art sub pen.  New York Senator Clark Ashton was in attendance, as was industrialist Bob Page whose subsidiaries handled many of the contracts for the construction of the new building.

<P>"This is certainly a great day for New York," said Page in a brief speech to commemorate the occassion.  "New York is, in many ways, the symbolic center of America, an example to not only the rest of the country but the world.  As long as New York remains mindful of its past but dedicated towards realizing its future, this will never change.  This building is only a small -- but significant -- step in the continual renewal of the city, and Page Industries is glad to be a part of that."
