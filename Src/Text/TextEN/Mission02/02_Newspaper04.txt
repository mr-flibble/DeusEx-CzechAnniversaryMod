<P><B>Court Upholds NY Grid Law</B>
<P>New World Press - Washington, D.C.
<P>
<P>In a landmark six to three decision yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the controversial "grid zoning" laws that have been the subject of a number suits since being instituted six years ago.
<P>
<P>Originally passed by the New York legislature in 2046 in response to the Upper West Side bombing that killed 45 people and wounded over a 100, the grid zoning laws effectively allowed the police to wall off regions of Manhattan and its surrounding boroughs.  Foot traffic between these "zones" is prohibited, and travelling between zones is restricted to authorized subways or highways subject to police surveillance.
<P>
<P>"A travesty," said Gil Treble, representing the ACLU as plantiffs in the case.  "This law is nothing more than the legalization of social oppression on a grand scale."
<P>
<P>Supreme Court Justice Machen wrote in his favorable decision that "The unfortunate nature of American liberty is that freedom creates opportunity for terror.  It is with heavy heart that I must conclude in this case that the freedom of individual Americans must be balanced against the needs of a community to feel safe and secure."
