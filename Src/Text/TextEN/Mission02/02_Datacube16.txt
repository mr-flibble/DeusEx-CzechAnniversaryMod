<P>Commander Grimaldi -- we liberated two canisters of this stuff along with the Ambrosia during the Liberty Island raid, but none of our people are quite sure what it is or what to do with it -- possibly a biological or chemical agent, but without the proper people and equipment there's no way to tell.  Lebedev suggested we keep one of the canisters and a barrel of Ambrosia here as a contingency; the rest was shipped out to the airfield an hour ago.
