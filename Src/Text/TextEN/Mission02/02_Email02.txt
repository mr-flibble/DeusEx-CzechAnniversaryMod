<P>
<P>Hello Friend,
<P>
<P>Has life become too impersonal, too tedius, too painful for you?  Then now is the time to exert control, to make that decision which is ultimately the only real choice we ever have: the decision to die.
<P>
<P>Some may describe this as an act of selfishness, but with the dwindling reserves of natural resources throughout the world you're actually contributing to the well-being of all those around you.  A recent bill passed by the United States Congress even authorizes a one-time payment of c10,000 to your chosen benefactor upon passing away.
<P>
<P>So do yourself, your family, and your friends a favor and visit any one of the KVORK, Inc. clinics in a neighborhood near you. We'll help you make a difference -- quickly and quietly.
<P>
<P>Sincerely,
<P>
<P>Derek Schmitt
<P>Director of Development, KVORK, inc.
