<P>
<P>The Oracle says:
<P>
<P>We did as asked and checked with our sources, pulled up black project lists from deadspace Net ghosts, performed intrusion runs on Throne/6G systems, everything.  Called in all markers.  Best we can say after eight-variable cross check on all available info is your friend did some under-the-table work in youth: very deep, very wet.  Few specifics, but we were to divine that it involved the chlorine assisted delivery of weaponized particles.  We show 86.73% likelihood that this work is contributing factor to his disappearance.
<P>
<P>We can tell you this much as well -- was not taken by any known national or international security organization.  We cannot determine responsible party and this troubles us.
<P>
<P>We consider our debt repaid.  No further communication between us will occur.
