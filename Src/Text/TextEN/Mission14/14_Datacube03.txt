<P>Ridley's done something to the computers, some kind of tunneling virus with an adaptable polymorph engine like I've never seen before.  Way advanced stuff.  It's overwhelming the self-repair routines and I figure we've got thirty, maybe forty minutes before this whole place goes haywire.  I'll do what I can to block it, but as a CYA I installed a low-level login at root with a recursive refresh built into the protected ring -- if worse comes to worse, it _should_ give us access to the security computers even if the virus brings down the rest of the system.  Hopefully.
