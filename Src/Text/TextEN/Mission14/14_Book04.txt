<P>"You are a very fine fellow," he said.  "You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity.  And you're right enough about humanity, about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper.  But you're not right about Renard.  I suspected him from the first.  He's rationalistic, and, what's worse, he's rich.  When duty and religion are really destroyed, it will be by the rich."
