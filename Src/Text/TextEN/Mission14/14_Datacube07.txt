<P>
<P>I've got fires going up all over the place and I don't know if I'll be able to put them all out -- this is getting serious.  Security locks have failed on the containment pens and a bunch of the cameras don't seem to be functioning so there's no way to track any escaped animals.  I just got a call that the turrets on the Command Level went active and started shooting everything in the room.  I'm _way_ over my head and I can't even raise you or anyone else on the horn.  I'm going down to the UC lab, so look for me there if you get this note. -- Yushio
