<P>I found that data Gary was asking for in the stuff we managed to bring with us from Area 51 -- genetic profiles for a "<PLAYERNAME>."  For some reason he thought they'd be a good baseline to use when calibrating the UC organic construction parameters.  Anyways, find them attached and let me know if you've got any questions.
