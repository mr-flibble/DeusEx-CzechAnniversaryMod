<P>It's funny, in the army you get shifted around so often you develop attachments to any place you can call home for more than nine months, and I've been at Vandenberg for more than ten years.  My family has grown up here.  I'm actually sorry to see it go.  But you've been a big help to all of us, Derek, and I appreciate your efforts in getting us moved out to Fort Jasper -- it'll be good to actually sit down and have a beer with you again in person.

<P>I heard yesterday that the government has sold off the base to some research consortium.  They must have deep pockets if they're willing to fix all the structural damage that's cropped up since the Big One a few years back.  Strange birds, real quiet.  Probably ex-military would be my guess.  Anyways, I'm sure I'll have some stories for you by the time I make it up there.  Should be next week.
<P>
<P>Give my best to Kim,
<P>Chip
