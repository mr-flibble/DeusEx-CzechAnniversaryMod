<P>I'm starting to pick up signals on the temblor sensors consistent with a small assault force.  I'm not sure if they think that little of us, or if they're just in such a rush to stop us that this was the best they could manage.  Either way, I hope those Hong Kong bots we got from your mysterious benefactor can do the trick.  We've probably got an hour before they arrive, so I'm going to go run a systems check on the bots before everything goes to hell. -- Carla
