<P>
<P>I'm about ready to leave, Dad.  Carla and Stacy have done their best to outfit me with everything I need.  You know, when I was a little girl I never really fantasized about being a spy or a thief or a princess... I always wanted to be a scientist, just like you.  Methodical and careful, that's exactly how you always taught me to work, and that's exactly how I'll be.
<P>
<P>I know we'll see each other before I leave, but I wanted you to know how proud I am of you and what you're doing, and how glad I am that I can be a part of it.  Mom would have been proud of you, too.  I just don't know if I can say all that when I'm standing there in front of you, so this will have to do until I get back.
<P>
<P>Love,
<P>Tiffany
