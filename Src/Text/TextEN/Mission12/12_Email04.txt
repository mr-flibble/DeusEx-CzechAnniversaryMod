<P>
<P>When we left MJ12, I think all of us knew that we had a long road ahead.  And for many of us, myself included, it has been a road of penance.  I have been a good scientist, but I may not have been a good human being; I did not think about the consequences of the knowledge that I fought so hard to gain, or about the people who would exploit it for their own ambitions.
<P>
<P>Now we must face up to the decisions we've made and stand against those who would eradicate our efforts to create a better future for our children and the world.  I've already lost too many friends and I don't intend on losing any more -- the bots should do most of the fighting, God willing.  But we all need to understand what is at stake: if we can bring the UC online, we might have a chance.  But if MJ12 succeeds then everything we've done, everyone who's been taken from us, all will be for nothing.
<P>
<P>As a scientist I find it strange to write these words, but circumstances have forced me to take a broader perspective.  What we win today is a chance at tomorrow, and that is something well worth the fight -- a fight I hope you will all join me in.
<P>
