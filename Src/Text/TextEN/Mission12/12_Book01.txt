<P>Jacob looked at her and watched all the regret drain from her eyes.  She tossed the empty revolver onto the body next to her, the gun in her other hand never moving an inch from a point that Jacob guessed was just above the bridge of his nose.

<P>Jacob knelt and rubbed his fingers in her blood.  Monk never missed with a sniper rifle.  Not ever.
