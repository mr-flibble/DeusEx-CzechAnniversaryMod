<P>
<P>>I've done several run-up tests on the reaction modules
<P>>and I'm a little concerned about the power curves --
<P>>you'll find some samples attached from the last run.
<P>>We're getting a pretty steep rise in the sigma variance.
<P>
<P>I believe the variance can be explained by an interference pattern from the reaction module linkages; we had a similar problem at Area 51 resulting from the feedback paths -- but keep an eye on it anyways.  We can't afford a repeat of what happened there.
