<P>It took me a while to track you down, Gary -- you've covered your tracks well, but I still know a few tricks... and a few people.  Which is part of the reason I'm writing.
<P>
<P>Ever since I left the Army a couple years back I've been working for UNATCO.  It seems that they're a better organization in principle than practice, and I've become increasingly uncomfortable with their methods.  I've got my suspicions about other things, as well, but I'd prefer not to get into them over an open line.  Doesn't matter -- they've discharged everyone who didn't come to them right out of UNATCO Academy spouting the party line, so I'm gone as of today.

<P>Heard you had your own difference of opinions with the military research establishment and took off on your own.  I'm not sure what you're working on, but it might be related to something another friend of mine has uncovered and I'd like to help.  Let me know if you need another hand.  It'd be good to see you again.
