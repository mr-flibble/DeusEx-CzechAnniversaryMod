<P>SUBJECT: Status (Draft Text)
<P>
<P>We arrived at 18:27 today, three hours ahead of schedule.  The modifications to the cargo bays have been completed as specified and the helicopters should begin loading within the hour.  I trust your people will be careful with the cargo -- the crew of this ship is still my responsibility.
<P>
<P>Be careful of my Ling; she is my responsibility as well.
