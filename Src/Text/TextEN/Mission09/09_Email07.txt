<P>The VersaLife situation has been corrected.  All evidence of MJ12 involvement was removed prior to the building being demolished, effectively removing all secondary and tertiary evidence along with key compromised personnel.  We have leaked items to the press implicating Denton and his associates and have received favorable feedback from our sources.  Production of the Non-Eutactic Blade (NEB) has been only temporarily delayed and will be shifted to other technology centers with minimal impact to the overall schedule.
