<P>Doctor Liu,

<P>I'm afraid we've completely gone through all of our motion sickness medication -- if you could restock the lockers downstairs, that'd be great.  I have a feeling this is going to be a rough outing.  BTW, Song's been running around changing all the codes lately, so if you need to raise the bridge in engineering use 9753.
