<P>
<P>Yes, sir.  My apologies, and I will certainly see to it that your orders are carried out with all speed and precision.  Please let me know if you require anything else.
<P>
<P>>FEMA requires you to comply during this crisis situation,
<P>>and you are legally obligated to do so: we are attempting
<P>>to control an insect population that may be a carrier for
<P>>the Gray Death.  If you do not devote your fullest enthusiasm
<P>>to this operation then you can and will be summarily court
<P>>martialed.  If you have any questions about my authority,
<P>>refer them to Rear Admiral Radchek.
<P>>
<P>>>I have to question whether this is the best possible use
<P>>>of the Advanced Submarine Facility, and whether placing Navy
<P>>>personnel under FEMA command is advisable.
<P>>>
<P>>>>Once the Wall Cloud has docked, the submarine facility will
<P>>>>be cordoned off and only FEMA or authorized security personnel
<P>>>>given access; you will work with Agent Jenkins to coordinate
<P>>>>this.  Helicopters will arrive shortly thereafter to be fitted
<P>>>>with sprayer attachments and loaded with pesticide from the
<P>>>>tanker.
