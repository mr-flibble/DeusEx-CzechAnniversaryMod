<P>The Te-Wu have been most intrigued by your information regarding Walton Simons and the implied threats towards you and your family.  The well-being of any one family is certainly the primary concern of the Chinese people and their chosen instruments.  However, we are also troubled by your reluctance to appear for counseling and the apparent use of a registered Chinese freighter in a way that does not contribute to the communal good.  We would hope that you have not made regrettable decisions in the absence of appropriate advice.  Please contact us immediately so that we may discuss your involvement and the correct course of action for both yourself and your family.
<P>
<P>Comrade Advisor Fengyi Gong
