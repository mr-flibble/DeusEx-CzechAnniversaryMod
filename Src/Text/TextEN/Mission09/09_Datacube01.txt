<P>Captain Keene:
<P>
<P>While the PRCS Wall Cloud is in port I fully expect your cooperation in adhering to FEMA security protocols.  Due to the sensitive nature of the Wall Cloud's cargo, the ship will be in lock-down while docked and only the minimum necessary personnel given clearance at any time.  Please contact the dock foreman with an access code for his people -- I trust you will oversee the operation and insure that he understands the necessity for these precautions.
