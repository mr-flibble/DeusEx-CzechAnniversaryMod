<P>
<P>I have downloaded the latest keyhole surveillance and given the projected weather and tides for the next 12 hours, the PRCS Wall Cloud should dock ahead of schedule at 18:40.  All clearances to the sub pen have been revoked and, with the exception of a small maintenance crew, all base personnel have been evacuated from the facility.  I will coordinate perimeter and security with Captain Keene.
<P>
<P>We should be able to begin loading of the helicopters within two hours of the Wall Cloud's arrival.  I will contact you again once the operation has commenced.
