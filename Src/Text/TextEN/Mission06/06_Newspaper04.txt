<P>Hong Kong Standard
<P>
<P>Explosions rocked the Wan Chai district two days ago as fighting between warring Triads resulted in the cave-in and flooding of the Canal Road Tunnel, effectively halting almost all access to and from the Wan Chai area.  While the fighting occurred in the early hours of the morning and traffic was light, a number of bystanders were trapped during the fighting and subsequently presumed dead.  The names of the deceased have not been released at this time.
<P>
<P>Police have barricaded the area at the Wan Chai terminal and forbidden any access until a thorough forensic analysis can be made and the bodies removed.  In a statement released earlier today the police declined to name any suspects, though Chief Joey Leung expressed that the "reprehensible nature of this crime will not go unanswered by the Hong Kong police."
