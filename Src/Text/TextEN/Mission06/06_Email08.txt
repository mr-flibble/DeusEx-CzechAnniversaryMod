<P>
<P>I've recently heard some negative discussion in the halls of VersaLife that I'd like to address: we here at VersaLife are doing a difficult job, the kind of job that few people ever have the opportunity to pursue -- because here at VersaLife we're changing the world.  A job such as this demands the commitment and dedication of those few, special individuals with the talent and determination to actually make that happen.  A family.  Your family.  By working together, there is nothing we can't achieve, but if we back off the throttle now it could result in a loss of momentum that would be disastrous.
<P>
<P>This is a war.  A war against disease and poverty, and if we're not willing to reach out and support our neighbor in the cubicle across from us, to get in that foxhole with them and jump on that grenade, to make the sacrifices necessary to create truly revolutionary products, then we've already lost.
<P>
<P>Negative attitudes will only poison the work environment of all those around you, but by trusting in the VersaLife family you can be sure that your best efforts will be rewarded.  We're already making changes, exciting changes, and I hope to tell you about them in future memos.
<P>
