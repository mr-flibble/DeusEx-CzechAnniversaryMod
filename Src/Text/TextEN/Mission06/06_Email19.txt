<P>Well, I've got your account all set up and you should be ready to go -- everything communications on Tracer's computers are completely ghost encrypted, so even if they go out over the standard HKNET there's no way anyone can intercept or read the messages.
<P>
<P>I've been talking a lot to Tracer and he's really an amazing person.  I think I can learn a lot from him.  I know you might find this odd, but all the time I worked for UNATCO seems like a dream, killing time in some virtual world so I didn't have to make the hard choices in the real one.  Now I feel like I've finally woken up.
<P>
