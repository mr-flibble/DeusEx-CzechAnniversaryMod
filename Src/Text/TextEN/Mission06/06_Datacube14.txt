<P>Party Leader Xan,
<P>
<P>I was much inspired by your speech to our local community resource center and wish to do my part in helping to maintain a free China: as you have said, there are many threats to that freedom both from within and without.
<P>
<P>It is with glad heart, then, that I am able to inform you of suspicious activities on the part of Dr. Tracey Feng.  Dr. Feng has declared on a number of occasions that he believes cases of "Gray Death" are going untreated (a situation I cannot believe the Party would permit), and has often been observed leaving at odd hours on what he declares to be "family emergencies."  I believe that Dr. Feng is a good individual, with the best hopes for Hong Kong and China at heart, and could thus benefit from counseling.
<P>
<P>Ms. Chow was kind enough to bring this to my attention, and should be saluted for the many hours of entertainment and happiness she has brought to the Chinese people.
