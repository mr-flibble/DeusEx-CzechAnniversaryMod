<P>Miracle Pictures today announced that Chris Todd's new picture "Pact of Shadows" was greenlit with a budget of c450 million.  The plot -- which has been one of the best kept secrets in the biz -- supposedly concerns an ongoing war between ancient secret societies and their struggle to wrest control from an infinitely older and more dangerous foe called simply "Leviathan."
<P>
<P>"It's an action-adventure-philosophy film" said Todd.  "And hopefully you'll see things -- experience things -- you've never had an opportunity to experience before.  With this movie I'm really hoping to build an intricate, engrossing tapestry of story and character -- before everything goes horribly awry, of course, and the real fun begins."

<P>The film, to be produced under the 7 Crows (www.7crows.com) banner, should begin shooting this Fall for a Christmas of next year release.
