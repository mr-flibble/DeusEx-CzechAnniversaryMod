<P><B>Subject:</B> Upgraded Commando Specs
<P>
<P>You were asking for the specs of our new commando units this morning, so I've attached the relevant files.  The short version is that most of the improvement in combat effectiveness comes from enhancements to their power armor developed here and in our labs in Zurich. 
<P>
<P>The new armor (we've nicknamed it "Obsidian") has greatly expanded possibilities as a light weapons platform, while a layer of microcore foam insulation disperses heat from flame and plasma attacks.  It's obviously invulnerable to any kind of gas or toxicological attack, as well.  Makes it perfect for riot control and NBC battlefields.  Beauty of it is the whole thing's powered by standard bioelectric cells.  I love it when you can just pull this stuff off the shelf.
<P>
<P>Anyways, let me know if you've got any more questions.
<P>
