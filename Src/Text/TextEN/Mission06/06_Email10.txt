<P>
<P>Underlit Publishing is pleased to announce the release of Sheldon Pacotti's previously unpublished first short story collection, "Slower than Pynchon."
<P>
<P>Pacotti's work -- including such modern classics as "Demiurge," "Blue Time in B-Minor," and the award-winning short-story "Calculated Regrets" -- has often been compared to that of a later day Paul Auster or Thomas Pynchon (after whom the short story collection was titled), but with a modern, technological sensibility.  Pacotti was also an integral part of the fabulist revival that has been popularized in the last decade.
<P>
<P>The publication marks the first time "Slower than Pynchon" has been made available since its inception, and represents a crucial period in Pacotti's development as a writer. It will be available for download from www.sheldonpacotti.com later today.
