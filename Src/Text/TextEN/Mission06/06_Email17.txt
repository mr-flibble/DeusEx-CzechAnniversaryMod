<P>I've attached a preliminary schedule for the Gray Project and want to get your input before we meet next week.  Couple of issues I want to whiteboard are their ability to spontaneously generate radiation as a form of "attack," and their apparent resistance to a number of environmental conditions.
<P>
<P>We're still trying to resurrect all the information from the old Dreamland data wells, but we have managed to extract a complete genetic sequence from the old bovine experiments that have given us two viable test subjects.  They've been isolated in a radioactive field downstairs for observation if you want to work up your informal impressions prior to the meeting.
<P>
<P>BTW, we still haven't heard from Feng about the karkian eggs -- we've got the Hong Kong police out looking for him now, but we'll need to push back our planned infant karkian development studies until we hear something.
<P>
<P>Thanks,
<P>Dr. Lundquist
