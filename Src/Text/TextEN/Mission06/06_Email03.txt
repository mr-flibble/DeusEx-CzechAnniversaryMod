<P>
<P>I have reviewed your latest report concerning the theft of the prototype sword and subsequent recovery efforts; you are to be commended for your swift response and exploitation of the theft to escalate tensions between the major Triads.  The resulting struggle will obviously weaken the native power structure, and I have already ordered an increased MJ12 presence to be placed under your command for local operations.  Solidifying our control over Hong Kong is a necessary first step in bringing the recalcitrant Chinese authorities to heel.
<P>
<P>We've also received reports that Agent Denton ("<PLAYERFIRSTNAME>") may be heading to Hong Kong for a possible rendevous with "Tracer Tong" in a stolen SH-187.  If possible, attempt to use your local connections to learn the whereabouts of Tong, then terminate them both.
