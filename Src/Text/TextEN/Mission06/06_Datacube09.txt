<P>I think something bad is happening downstairs, but I don't know what.  Yesterday I found a man in the bathroom, dressed in street clothes and raving about...I don't know what.  Doctors and the things they did to him.  Downstairs, he said, but there is no downstairs. I don't know how he got into the building.  When I called security a bunch of scary guys in riot armor showed up -- they didn't say anything, just shot him with a dart.  He stopped talking.  Maybe he was dead.  When I tried to get closer they shoved me half-way across the room, like swatting an insect.
<P>
<P>My supervisor came.  Questioned me about "loyalty" and "shared objectives with the program."  Mentioned how dangerous Hong Kong streets were, that security was for my protection, and that it was there to prevent unfortunate incidents.
<P>
<P>There are more of the guys in scary riot armor.  They are coming this way.  I think I'll take a restroom break.
