<P>
<P>Simons has requested that we equip some of the Series P agents with prototype Non-Eutactic Blades, prior to their mass production, so that additonal functional data can be generated.  I've also been assured by Ms. Chow that the stolen NEB has been recovered from the Triads and our security procedures updated accordingly.  Please let me know ASAP when the prototype NEBs can be distributed.

<P>Let's grab some drinks tomorrow night.  Anne's been bugging me to get out more often and with the kid on the way I might as take advantage of it before I'm up all night with the newborn.
<P>
<P>Thanks,
<P>Dr. Lundquist
