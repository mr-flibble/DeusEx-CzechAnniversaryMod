<P>FROM: WAN CHAI DISTRICT, POST 11384
<P>TO: CENTRAL POLICE COMMAND, H.K.
<P>
<P>Attached you will find a full surveillance report for the activities of subject MAGGIE CHOW (HKS0084393).  Ms. Chow's associations with the RED ARROW TRIAD and its Dragon Head, MAX CHEN, are a matter of record; however, recent evidence indicates that she may also have been involved with the death of Chen's predecessor, YUEN KONG (HKS0134091), a contributing factor to the current gang war.  Ms. Chow and her relationship to the VERSALIFE CORPORATION are also under investigation, but show a high probability of being linked to the recent conflict between the Triads.
<P>
<P>District officers are respectfully asked to note that there are several tactical options for accessing Ms. Chow's penthouse: a service entrance at the rear of the address; a renovation project in progress on the building's seventh floor; and the roof. These options are outlined more fully in the surveillance report if it becomes necessary to detain Ms. Chow or search her premises.
<P>
<P>Commander Cheung
