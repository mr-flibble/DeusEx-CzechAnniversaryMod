<P>Please use the following map, provided at no cost, to enjoy and see our beautiful district.  In Wan Chai Market is where you will take in tea, buy a bird, and shop for antiques and other wonderments!  The Old China Hand and Lucky Money Club have dancing and drinks for all.  End your day with much ovation in a sampan ride through the historic canal, or observe ceremonies at the authentic temple in the main square.
