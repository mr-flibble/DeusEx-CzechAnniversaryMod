<P>They'd fire me on the spot if they knew I was sending you this message, but I've got a feeling they'll be drumming me out any day now as is.  Alex tells me there's no way this communication can be traced, so I trust he knows what the hell he's doing.
<P>
<P>I understand why you did it.  Being a soldier isn't just following orders, it's following those orders in the service of a higher cause.  When that cause is betrayed, we're not soldiers anymore -- just pieces on a chess board dying for the wrong reasons.
<P>
<P>Things've been bad since you left.  Manderley has disappeared; they say he's been relieved of duty.  The Director of FEMA, Walton Simons, has assumed interim authority, but there's something about him I don't like.  He seems reasonable, but there's something behind his eyes.  I saw the same look on men in combat when all the part of them that was human just left.
<P>
<P>I have some friends who used to be associated with UNATCO -- they've disappeared, but I may see if I can find them again.  Maybe they'll be useful to you.  We'll see.  In the meanwhile, do what you think is right, J.C., and let the Devil take the rest.
