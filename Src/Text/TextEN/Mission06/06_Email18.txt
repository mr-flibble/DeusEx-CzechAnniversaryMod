<P>Max, we have been friends since we were children, so I hope you will not find any disrespect in what I am about to say -- but first, I must express again my great sorrow at the death of Yuen.  He was the first of many great Dragon Heads, and I know you will follow in the same emminent tradition.  We here at police headquarters are doing our best to locate his killer, and I will be sure that you have ample opportunity to discuss the matter with them once they have been found.
<P>
<P>But with all this said, it must also be said that the dispute between the Red Arrow and the Luminous Path has become unseemly and not in the best interests of the people of Hong Kong.  The recent collapse of the Canal Road tunnel was unfortunate and has resulted in many problems.  I have been forced to authorize the use of unpleasant measures if this continues.
<P>
<P>Please contact me so that we may discuss this and resolve the situation before it worsens.
<P>
<P>Your Friend,
<P>Fong
