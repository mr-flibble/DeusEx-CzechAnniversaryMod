<P>There is little time. You should know that the organization for which you have worked, whose goals and interests you believed to be your own, is not what it seems.  UNATCO is merely an arm of a larger entity known as Majestic 12.  Majestic 12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control.  Of everything.  They will not hesitate to use all means necessary to achieve this goal, and have engineered the disease you refer to as the "Gray Death" in an effort to accomplish this.
<P>
<P>They must not be allowed to succeed.  Your brother has been an aid to me in this matter but cannot help me any longer.  You must take his place.  The Gray Death is a nanotechnologically engineered virus.  You are immune, but others are not.  You must locate the Universal Constructor used to create the Gray Death and destroy it.  My information indicates that it is in Hong Kong, housed in a Majestic 12 facility beneath the corporation known as VersaLife.
<P>
<P>You must not fail.
