<P>Time is short.  If you've followed orders, you should be on your way back to Hong Kong.  Tong will know what to do, so help him.  We can't let these bastards get away with what they've done, and what they still might do.
<P>
<P>My brother... my brother may be able to help.  I don't know.  I've sent him to obtain the evidence I compiled of UNATCO's recent activities, but -- I've had to treat him and everyone else I know like pawns.  I've sent them to be killed and all so that we could win the larger game.  But I think my time to be sacrificed is about to come.
<P>
<P>If Tong gives you the word, take down Maggie.
<P>
<P>And if I see you again, you're buying the beers this time.
