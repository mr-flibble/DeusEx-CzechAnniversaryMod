<P>Continue monitoring the situation with the augmented units; I want all possible wetware recovered from the primary unit, but your top priority should be the interrogation of the secondary unit ("<PLAYERNAME>").  Viability of the secondary unit is of non-importance now that the killswitch has been activated -- I'd like any procedures employed selected with an eye towards maximum informational yield.

<P>Until the freighter preparations have been completed, you will have full authority over UNATCO headquarters and attached facilities.
