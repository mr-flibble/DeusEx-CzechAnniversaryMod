<P>
<P>We are disappointed in your performance to date, particularly with regards to <PLAYERNAME> -- while both he and his brother were expendable, considerable time and effort was involved in their creation.  Pending a more thorough post mortem, we can only assume that your handling of them must bear part of the blame.  We'll discuss this further in holoconference, but until then I've given Agent Sherman full authority over UNATCO headquarters and MJ12 facilities.
<P>
<P>I've also assigned Dr. Reyes to evaluate the performance of the killswitches for the nano-augmented agents.  Maintain a close observation of him and report any inconsistencies in his behavior immediately.  Further security breaches will not be tolerated.
