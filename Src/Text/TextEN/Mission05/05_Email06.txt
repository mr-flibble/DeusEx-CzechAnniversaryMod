<P><B>Subject:</B> Killswitch Evaluation
<P>
<P>With your impressive grasp of nano-augmentation I thought it appropriate that you should participate in the evaluation of J.C. Denton's killswitch.  It's unfortunate when situations such as this occur, particularly when they involve agents with the obvious talents and abilities of the Denton brothers.  But given the need to protect civilians from potential rogue operatives, I'm sure you'll understand the necessity of developing a more effective killswitch, something similar to the instantaneous killphrases installed in all our mechanically augmented agents.  Please contact Agent Sherman for the evalutation methodology.
