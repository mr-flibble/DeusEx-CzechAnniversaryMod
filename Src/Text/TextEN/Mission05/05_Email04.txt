<P>Dr. Moreau,
<P>
<P>I must request yet again that you forward me the results of your study on greasel venom toxcitiy with reference to the karkian neurological cultures I have previously provided you with so that I can conclude my bio evaluation.  This delay on your part could be construed as a lack of enthusiasm for our research goals.
<P>
<P>Sincerly,
<P>Dr. Elmwood
