<P>Dr. Alibek:
<P>
<P>Your facility is one of the first to receive our new production model plasma gun; as you know, this weapon will be phased into use first by our special operations teams, then by selected elements of our military and security organization over the next month.  As one of our leading weapons researchers in North America, we are certainly interested in any opinions you might have regarding its combat effectiveness.  Attached you should find the full technical specifications.  Please feel free to correspond with me directly if you have any further questions.
<P>
<P>The code for the security container is 5239.
