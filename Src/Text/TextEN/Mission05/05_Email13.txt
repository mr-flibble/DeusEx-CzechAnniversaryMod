<P>
<P>New detachments of MJ12 commando units are now being refitted and should come online shortly.  Upgraded units will initially be assigned on an "as necessary" basis to high priority MJ12 facilities; one of the first teams should arrive at your location within forty-eight hours to be placed directly under your command.
<P>
<P>In addition to their standard 7.62mm firearms, short range rockets have been added to their arsenal.  Enhanced power armor utilizing heat-dispersing foam insulation will greatly reduce damage from fire or plasma weaponry, while ballistic shielding provides significant protection from small arms fire.  An integrated rebreather also renders them invulnerable to any aerosol or gas weapons.
<P>
<P>Use this team and your discretion to maintain the integrity of the facility and support MJ12 forces already in New York.
