<P><B>Notebook of Giuliano Jordorowsky</B>
<P>
<P>... This job is so boring.  I do nothing but write in my notebook, fill it with my thoughts, but sometimes I must amuse myself.  I have been stealing from the security... like thick-skulled dogs, they are.  Last week I took a watch, but they paid no notice.  I am nothing to them.  Just the strange man with his notebook.
<P>
<P>I was listening to the night guard, Jobal.  A disgusting creature, and a creature of habit.  I heard him on the phone -- talking to that cow of a girlfriend -- and he told her his bank account number.  I almost got his PIN as well, but a passing train drowned him out.  I do not know the last number.  I will try again when he is on shift next week.
<P>
<P>Account: 576001
<P>PIN: wyrdred0-
<P>
<P>He will be surprised when all his money is gone, and they will not suspect me...
