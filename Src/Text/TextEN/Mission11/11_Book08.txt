<P><JC><B>Testament of Adept 34501</B>
<P>
<P>My name has been taken from me, a thing I need not anymore, and I have been christened Adept 34501.  They have set me to keep a record of this place, to record a history of its comings and goings so that Those Who Rule might have the benefit of its knowledge...
<P>
<P>... today saw the arrival of Agent Hermann.  He is a simple thing, fitted to a dark purpose by forces he cannot understand.  In a way, I feel pity for him -- an emotion that I know will prevent my advancement beyond the Third Rank -- but it is pity I feel nonetheless.  He has spent most of his time below in the technology archive, staring at the ancient cross above his head.  He burns with a hatred that I can feel, for himself and for someone else.  Periodically he will receive holographic communications from Simons, after which his hatred burns all the brighter.  I think it has burned away everything human in him, and only the metal holds him together anymore...
