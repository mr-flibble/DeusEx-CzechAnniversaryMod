<P><B>Local Sights: Cathedrale de Payens</B>
<P>
<P>Though overshadowed by several larger and more well-known cathedrals, the Cathedrale de Payens in the 14th arrondissement remains a historical curiosity of interest to many scholars.  Construction was begun in 1218 and completed before the end of the century, financed by the Templar Knights -- an order of warrior monks -- as part of a similar network of churches, cathedrals, and forts (or "commanderies" as they were called) throughout Britain, Europe, and the Holy Lands.
<P>
<P>Some scholars believe that the order did not disappear in 1311 with its dissolution, however, and that the Templar Knights continued to operate more or less in secret -- but whatever the truth, Payens fell into disrepair until finally purchased and rennovated by a group of European investors in 1918 as a corporate retreat.  While closed to the public, it still remains a comforting presence at the heart of the arrondissement.
