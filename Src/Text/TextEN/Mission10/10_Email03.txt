<P>Nicolette,
<P>
<P>Your aid in securing support for Silhouette has been invaluable -- you've done much to help sustain the cause of freedom in the face of ever more open repression by our own government.  However, I'm afraid that I must ask for your help yet again.  The police have begun to raid the Catacombs, and if we are to put up an effective resistance then we must locate additional resources by whatever means necessary.  I know your mother and her friends wish to remain anonymous, but any funds or material that they can contribute will be of enormous help.  And even if they cannot, their continued good-will is still of great importance to us all.
<P>
<P>Thank you, and I hope to see you again soon.
<P>--
<P>Chad
