<P><B>EXCLUSIVE: BOB PAGE INTERVIEW</B>
<P>Affaires le France

<P>AF: ... And now France?
<P>
<P>BP: Yes, France.  France -- and Europe -- have prospered for thousands of years... it would be foolish to ignore the economic and cultural opportunities that exist here.  This country has a huge reserve of talent, in all sectors of the work force, and Page Industries is looking forward to recruiting the best and the brightest.

<P>AF: But what about the turmoil that seems to be afflicting much of the continent, the rise of radical splinter groups such as SCHUSE and Silhouette?
<P>
<P>BP: Intimidation through violence is the last resort of the weak... these groups are composed of nothing but frustrated, gullible individuals.  We have a very effective security organization that will be working with both local and national authorities to minimize whatever potential for actual harm they present.
<P>
<P>AF: So you see yourself working closely with the government?
<P>
<P>BP: Very closely...
