<P>Citizens of Paris, did you even turn in your sleep as your <I>freedom</I> was seized from you?  Did you hear them when they told you it was done in your name?  Or did you simply wake from your dream and never question the reality of your <I>slavery</I>?
<P>
<P>The City of Lights has been extinguished by Shadows.  Our government has been taken from us.  We live in fear of jack-booted troops and hulking, clanking tools of oppression, afraid to travel from one arrondissement to another.  Where is the city of our dreams?  The Pigalle has become the grave for our buried joy, the Champs-Elysées rings of nothing but the dirge of our forgotten hopes.
<P>
<P>We let this happen, we <I>_all_</I> let this happen -- but it is not too late!  We are free in our hearts and our minds, and it is there that true rebellion must begin.  Look to those who would unify us only to enslave of us.  Look to those who would make us rich but rob our souls.  Look to those who would protect our safety by stealing our liberty.  Question everything.  Believe nothing.  Take action in the places they cannot see and they can never conquer us.
<P>
<P>SILHOUETTE, MINISTER OF TRUE LIES
