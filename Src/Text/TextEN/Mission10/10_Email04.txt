<P>>they need help or they'll be slaughtered by the porcs who strut
<P>>about the streets like they own them.  You've helped us once
<P>>before, and it has meant so much to the cause.  Please, mother,
<P>>I'm asking you to help us again.  You know so many who can
<P>
<P>I will do what I can, dear, but the situation is far more complicated than I think you may be aware of -- my connections within the Hague and the United Nations indicate that the problem is not limited to France, and many parties are using the "Gray Death" epidemic as an excuse to exercise their control over other national governments.  I have to consult with Morgan.  We must be careful where we choose to allocate our resources.
<P>
<P>It is a very dangerous time -- for everyone, Nicolette -- and your flirtation with this organization could have serious consequences.  I am asking you again to be careful.  I could not stand it if something happened to you.  In the meanwhile, I will do what I can.
<P>
<P>Beth
