<P>
<P>... with the new government regulations it has become almost impossible to get any work done after sundown... the <I>sourd-muet</I> bots will supposedly only attack known terrorists, but I do not trust them, and neither does anyone else.  They all head home before dark.  I stay and try to get a little work done so the American MIS woman gave me a passcode for the security system (rzelazny/shadowjack), but it is difficult to make any progress when no one is around to give me the information I need...
