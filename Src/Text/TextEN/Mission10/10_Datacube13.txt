<P>Dear Nicolette, if you examine my suspension vault you'll find an item that I had to pay quite dearly to acquire; the vault code is 1784. I don't know of what use it may be, but many people are quite prepared to kill for it.  I originally obtained it for Morgan and if you find yourself in trouble, he may still be willing to bargain for it. He is a calculating man, not without compassion but still dangerous.  Be careful, my daughter.
<P>
<P>Beth
