<P>It was late when he got back.  Everything black and quiet.  Jacob killed the lights but didn't take the key out of the ignition.  He reached into his pocket and took out a little box with an LCD display, thumbed a button and the radio transceiver captured the last few hours worth of motion sensor logs from the building.  He'd done some favors for friends in the Shop -- or whatever it was they were calling it this week -- and they'd installed it to spec for him.

<P>As he walked to the door he was still arranging all the pieces in his head.  Sure way to get his ass taken down, but he couldn't help it.  Something was missing.  Didn't fit.  Allie hunched over in the bathroom, that needle dangling from between her toes.  Katsuya shifting a half million yen before the currency market closed.  The radio station Samuel had turned him on to, the one with the little girl repeating all those numbers in sequence.  And somewhere in the middle...
<P>
<P>Jacob stopped, looked up at the night sky.  He'd been assuming that there were two sides to this game and both were playing to win. But what if... what if there was someone else, and they wanted to see both sides lose?
