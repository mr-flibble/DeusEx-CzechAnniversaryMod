<P><JC>by Charles Francois Guillermot
<P>
<P>... And it is told that he made his way through their streets
<P>at night, crawling through their many windows and crouching in
<P>their gardens, moving
<P>through the sewers beneath their cobbled roads and
<P>slipping over their railings.
<P>
<P>Watched by their cats and the roosting pidgeons of their city,
<P>yet wary of their slumbering dogs, he went.  They would not see
<P>him, nor wake as he drew near,
<P>but would only shudder, softly calling out the names of their
<P>gods in sleep.
<P>
<P>Restless, they tossed as he passed under the window like an
<P>errant lover fleeing dawn.
<P>
<P>And by morning light he was gone, away from that place, and
<P>moved on to another 
<P>world.
