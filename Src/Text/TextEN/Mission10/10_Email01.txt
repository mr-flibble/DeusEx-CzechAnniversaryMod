<P>This will be our last communication over the Net.  The so-called "Aquinas" protocols that my old protege and MJ12 have implemented are crude, but effective -- much like my protege.  All future meetings will need to occur face to face at a secure location.  To expedite matters I will deliver to you a "tear-sheet" chip: it will contain twenty codes and their corresponding keys.  Each code and key pair can be used once and then it will be permanently erased.  Each code will be tagged to one of our previously agreed upon meeting locations and times.  If one or the other of us should need to get in touch, send a message using one of the codes -- the content of the messsage is irrelevant, only the code used to encrypt it.
<P>
<P>I shouldn't need to point out that any attempt to tamper with the chip once it has been installed will result in it being rendered useless.
<P>
<P>Best of luck -- to you and to us all,
<P>Morgan
