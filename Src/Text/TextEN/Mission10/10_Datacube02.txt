<P>Dear Nicolette, at some point it may become necessary for you to access my private records, and perhaps to... to do what you think best, given the circumstances of my absence.  You must understand how much I care for you, and if I've not always done what might be considered right, I have always done what I thought best for you and the others I've cared about; it is a cold heart that does not have some regrets.

<P>This is all I can leave to you; everything else I have already given.  I love you my daughter, and I trust you will make me proud.  I am only sorry that I am not here to see it.
<P>
<P>Beth
