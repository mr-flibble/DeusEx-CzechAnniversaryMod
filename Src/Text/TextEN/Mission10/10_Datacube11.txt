<P>Agent Hela,
<P>
<P>We've added a login for you to the Catacombs security network; while still incomplete, it's being extended every day.  We should have the majority of the tunnels completely wired within the next three months.

<P>Login: Hela
<P>Password: Ragnarok
<P>
<P>Again, I'm pleased to know that you and MJ12 will be working closely with us to eradicate the Silhouette infestation from Paris.  Please update me on a daily basis with your surveillance reports and any additional items or information you may require.
<P>-- 
<P>Gabily
