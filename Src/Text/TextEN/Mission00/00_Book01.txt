<P><JC>Section 3C: Multitools
<P>
<P>A "multitool" is not really a tool at all -- not in the usual sense of the word -- but a disposable electronic device that utilizes electromagnetic resonance detection and frequency modulation to dynamically alter the flow of current through almost any non-hardened circuitry.  Skilled agents can use the multitool to manipulate code locks, cameras, autogun turrets, alarms, or other security elements.
<P>
<P>Note that multitools CANNOT be used for computer information extraction (see Section 5A: Hacking).
