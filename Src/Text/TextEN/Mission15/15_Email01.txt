<P>
<P>Your request for discussion concerning the plausibility of creating genetically viable candidates for nano-augmentation through cloning has sparked considerable interest.  We believe that with sufficient research investment, the careful cultivation of acquired tissue samples from known H type epsilon negative individuals could yield an indefinite number of specimens with the immunity factors required to tolerate the injection of nano-organic material.  If you examine the attached studies, you will see that repeated cloning from the primary source material will result in only a 0.53% immunoglobin variance.

<P>We would suggest utilizing the data acquired by the Illuminati during the smallpox vaccinations of the 1940s to genetically screen for those couples most likely to produce desirable offspring who could then be cloned and raised by the "parents" under carefully supervised conditions.  These cloned siblings would provide the necessary redundancy for further experimental trials.  In the future, this process could be streamlined through the application of accelerated growth and memory implantation.

<P>We look forward to hearing any comments that you might have,
<P>Dr. Olivaw
