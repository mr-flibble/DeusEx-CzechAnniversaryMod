<P>It's all very clear to me now... I don't know why it wasn't before.
<P>
<P>We have all sinned, and this is our punishment.
<P>
<P>Page is God.  He is the God we made, we crafted him in our likeness.
<P>
<P>Our God is a vengeful God, and a God who does not tolerate weakness.  We know his weaknesses, because we built him, so our God does not tolerate us.
<P>
<P>Our God made monsters.  He made them with the UC, then he sent them to find us.  Some of us tried to hide, but they didn't understand.  You can't hide from God, or his creatures.
<P>
<P>I've been waiting here, thinking.  Thinking about God, and the things I have done wrong.  If I think long enough and hard enough, maybe God will forgive me someday and make me again in the UC.
<P>
<P>All praise the UC, and all praise God.
