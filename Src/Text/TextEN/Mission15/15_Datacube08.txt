<P>MAINTENANCE LOG: PURVIS, J.
<P>
<P>* 19:45:12 -- ... Thought I heard something upstairs, like automatic weapons fire.  I reported it to my sector lead, but she told me it was a training exercise.
<P>
<P>* 20:34:02 -- Bunch of those folks in the black suits, like they stepped off the set of "Father Knows Best."  Kept asking questions about the reactors, and I just kept telling 'em they needed to wait till Mac gets back. 
<P>
<P>* 23:11:30 -- Finally managed to hack the code to the stairwell blast door (1038); this place is a totally undocumented mess of '50s tech, weird ass stuff, and new toys from the labs.  Amazing any of it works...
