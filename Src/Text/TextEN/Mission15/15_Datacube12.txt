<P>I'm moving all the explosives we find into storage.  I don't think there's any danger of sweating or spontaneous detonation -- this stuff looked like it was pretty stable -- but I thought it might be best to put it in a secure, structurally sound location.  If you or your people require access, the explosives locker code is 4225.
