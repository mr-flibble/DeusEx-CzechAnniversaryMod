<DC=255,255,255>
<P>MJ12 ADVANCE TEAM
<P>PROBLEM RECOMMENDATION REPORT 87-X
<P>FROM: CAPTAIN JAMES FLORES
<P>TO: AGENT KARYO
<P>PRR-ID: 7793G
<P>
<P>DESCRIPTION: After preliminary reconnaissance, I have determined that we have a potential security vulnerability in one of the outlying warehouses: an intake fan vent with a maintenance access hatch that could act as a possible method of ingress to the facility.  While such ingress would present definite hazards to any intruder, it is still an unacceptable risk for a Seraphic/8X classified facility.
<P>
<P>RECOMMENDATION: A squad should be dispatched to a) secure the area; b) weld the hatch shut; and c) install sensors and autoguns to extend our security grid coverage.
<P>
<P>NOTES: All troops not directly attached to MJ12 have been classified as a security liability and should be eliminated on sight.
