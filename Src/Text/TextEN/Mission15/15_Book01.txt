<P>
<P>Jacob sat down on the bench and unrolled his chess board onto the rough stone table in front of him.  As he was removing his playing pieces, a shadow fell across the board.  He looked up, squinting into the sun.
<P>
<P>"Merriweather," he said.
<P>
<P>"Jacob."  She settled herself down onto the opposite bench, leaning heavily on her cane.  "It didn't turn out so well for you this time, did it?"  Jacob said nothing.  She gestured to the board with one hand and he detected just a hint of a tremor.  "You're playing black today."
<P>
<P>He put the queen down on her square and his fingers lingered.  "No, it didn't turn out well.  I did some stupid things."  He closed his eyes for a moment.  "I cared, and some people died because of it."
<P>
<P>Merriweather made a tsking sound.  "It's not the caring that's a matter, Jacob, it's what comes after.  What are you going to do now?"
<P>
<P>Jacob paused for just a moment. "Now... I'm going to play another game."
