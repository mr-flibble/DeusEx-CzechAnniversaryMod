<P><B>Subject:</B> Secondary Unit
<P>
<P>I've come to believe that <PLAYERFIRSTNAME> should be brought up in a more supervised environment than his brother; I have serious doubts as to his brother's usefulness as our primary unit, and would rather that at least one of the secondary units was under our direct control.
<P>
<P>Terminate the parents, but see that <PLAYERFIRSTNAME> is not harmed.  We'll move him to our school in Switzerland where we can oversee his development.  If it becomes necessary, his brother is expendable.
