<P><B>Subject:</B> RE: Bovine Manipulation
<P>
<P>>I'd like to investigate the possibility of resurrecting
<P>>the bovine manipulation project (MJID-9803HU8932), with
<P>>an eye towards recreating the "Gray" lifeform -- while
<P>>the project was deemed a failure at the time, it _was_
<P>>successful as a propaganda tactic in diverting attention
<P>>away from actual Dreamland research.  With recent advances
<P>>in genetic science, the Gray lifeform could be engineered
<P>>to protect MJ12 facilities while also serving as a useful
<P>>bit of meme indirection.
<P>
<P>An interesting idea, Bob, but I'm sure MJ12's research allocations can be put to more substantial use pursuing our human augmentation projects; however, I'll bring up the idea with Stanton and Morgan.
