<P>Alain, I don't have much time -- I managed to hack into the archives maintained by Helios.  It was... amazing.  There were files and messages in there going back almost a hundred years, names of things I've only heard people whisper about as rumors.  I barely had time to get my bearings before the ice started to come down, and I just managed to snag a few e-mails that had been recently accessed before I was cut off.  I don't think anyone noticed, but I've got to go back on shift now or else someone really will be suspicious.  If you get a chance, find my machine and see if you can make anything out of what I recovered.
