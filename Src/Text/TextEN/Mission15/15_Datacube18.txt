<P>LAB 12 TESTING REGIMEN
<P>SUBJECT: LIFEFORM MJID-9803HU8932 ("GRAY")
<P>REGIMEN: SERIES 112-A
<P>
<P>PROCEDURE: "GRAY" LIFEFORM APPEARS TO THRIVE IN AREAS OF HIGH RADIOACTIVITY WHILE ALSO BEING ABLE TO STORE AND RELEASE RADIOACTIVITY IN A CONTROLLED MANNER THROUGH AN ORGAN OF UNKNOWN OPERATION.  FURTHER VIVISECTION IN COMBINATION WITH REGIMEN SERIES 112 WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE A COHESIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MECHANISM.  SERIES 112-A SEEKS TO ESTABLISH BASELINE READINGS OF THE "GRAY" LIFEFORM IN BOTH A RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE ENVIRONMENT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO SERIES 112-B.
<P>
<P>RESEARCHERS ACQUIRING BASELINE READINGS SHOULD USE CONTAINMENT AREA SECURITY CONSOLE WITH LOGIN "LAB 12" AND PASSWORD "GRAYTEST" TO ENABLE OR DISABLE RADIOACTIVE FIELD AS REQUIRED AND REPORT ALL FINDINGS TO DR. FRANK ROAN FOR PROCESSING.
