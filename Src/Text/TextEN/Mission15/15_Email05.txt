<P>In the past we've considered Savage and his renegades to be inconsequential -- possibly even useful -- but the time has come to eliminate them.  Mobilize all MJ12 units in the immediate vicinity and see to it that Vandenberg is shut down before Savage ever has a chance to activate his UC.

<P>Don't worry about Daedalus.  I've made some improvements to Icarus that might surprise even Everett.

<P>>Denton has connected with Savage and the X-51 researchers;
<P>>after examining the transaction records from Payens, it
<P>>looks like he's working with both Everett and Daedelus.
<P>>Strong says Savage is still missing a containment
<P>>vessel and that he's sent someone to the Pasadena lab in
<P>>an attempt to recover the data.  I already have a team
<P>>preparing to intercept.
