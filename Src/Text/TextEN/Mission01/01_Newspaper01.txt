<P><B>Mead Bucks Congress</B>
<P>APR - Washington D.C.
<P>
<P>Defying Congress for the third time this year, President Mead unilaterally paid the United States' late dues to the United Nations.  "Like good tenants, we must pay our rent on time," he told reporters.
<P>
<P>Leaders of both parties criticized the move.  "Where does he get the cash?" asked Senator Ridon (D-Illinois).  "Clearly from some budget item yet to be approved by this Congress."
<P>
<P>The Republicans were no kinder.  "This council member has been betrayed, and so has America," said Senator Osno Liverpoole (R-California).  "The Congress came together to approve a UNATCO presence on U.S. soil, but we did not write a blank check.  No, sir.  A superpower does not pay rent."
