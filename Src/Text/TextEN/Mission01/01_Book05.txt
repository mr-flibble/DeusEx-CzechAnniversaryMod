<P><JC>UNATCO and the Future
<P>
<P>As science progresses at an ever increasing rate, more and more advanced technology is finding its way into the hands of the common criminal, resulting in a deadly threat to LIFE and PROPERTY throughout the world.
<P>
<P>While it is impractical to restrict the free-flow of information already present in the public sector, UNATCO is committed to insuring that this threat does not go unaddressed.  Even now, UNATCO research and development employs some of the most talented scientific minds in the world to develop proprietary technologies in absolute security for field use by our agents -- including such innovations as the XXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXX, or the lifesaving XXXXX.
<P>
<P>Under NO circumstances should agents discuss ANY piece of equipment or technique currently employed by UNATCO.  Agents operating contrary to this directive will face immediate disciplinary action.
<P>
<P>Within our laboratories lies not just the future of law enforcement, but a SAFE, SECURE future for all mankind.
