<P><JC>UNATCO and the Press
<P>
<P>Because UNATCO will often deal with situations that cannot easily be contained, agents may unfortunately need to interact with the press.
<P>
<P>If you are not trained for such interaction, do not -- repeat, DO NOT -- speak with journalists, regardless of nationality.  They are skilled in misdirection and propaganda.  Refuse comment.  Remember: Security procedures are our first line of defence.  SECRETS are LIVES.
<P>
<P>Always refer reporters at crime scenes to UNATCO information officers and fact management teams.
