<P><B>Mass Grave in Brooklyn</B>
<P>APR - New York
<P>
<P>Responding to an outbreak of Gray Death that quickly overwhelmed all city services, National Guard forces were placed under the command of local law enforcement today and mobilized to help with disposal of the recently deceased in Brooklyn.
<P>
<P>However, the National Guard soon proved inadequate in containing the chaos and in many cases the dead were simply left lying in streets while the dying -- mostly homeless -- wandered the city until collapsing.  Traffic jams and looting remain widespread, and as fear of the disease continues to escalate, frequent riots have made any attempt at an organized clean-up impossible.  With the threat of secondary diseases looming, city officials have consulted with the CDC in Atlanta and ordered a mass grave to be dug in Gateway National Park.
