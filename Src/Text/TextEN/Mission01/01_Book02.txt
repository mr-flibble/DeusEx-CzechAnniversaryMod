<P><JC>UNATCO and the Public
<P>
<P>In carrying out their duties, UNATCO agents often come in contact with the public. 
<P>
<P>You are a PEACEKEEPER, and your first objective is to safeguard human life.  Though terrorists may see an advantage in harming civilians, UNATCO agents do not.  Issue a warning before firing at a suspect and always instruct bystanders to "get down on the ground."  Refrain from firing into large crowds.  Every civilian hurt is collateral damage.
<P>
<P>However, keep in mind that no civilian with a clearance below Angel/0A should be trusted and may be a potential spy.  ANYONE can be a spy, and secrecy is our ally.
<P>
<P>REMEMBER: WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
