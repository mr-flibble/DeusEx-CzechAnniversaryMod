<COMMENT>Datacube for Statue ATM account</COMMENT>
<DC=255,255,255>
<P>So many people use that ATM each day that it's busted 90% of the time.  But if it's working, you might need some cash today for the pub crawl we've got planned in the city.  Don't let the tourists get you down.  See you there tonight, sweetie.

<P>PS) I was serious last night--I really want to get married in the Statue.  We met there on duty and all our friends work there.
