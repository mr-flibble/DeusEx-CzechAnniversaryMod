<P><B>A Lesson for Our President</B>
<P>Family News Network -- Dave Wary Editorial
<P>
<P>When the other kids on my block elected me King of the World, a political office open (thankfully) only to eight-year-olds, I moved quickly to consolidate my power.  I declared that all subsequent elections were forbidden, that the office of King was reserved to me and my descendants for all eternity.
<P>
<P>I don't remember what morsels of political philosophy were hurled at me.  "That ain't fair!" perhaps, or "You can't do that!"
<P>
<P>My rebuttal?  "Yes I can.  I'm King."
<P>
<P>All subsequent debate involved rocks.  Even Gretchen, green-eyed lovely Gretchen, held me pinned to the ground as the others asserted their own right to the throne with whatever stones happened to be within easy reach.
<P>
<P>With a 35 percent approval rating after the U.N. funding fiasco, President Mead should reflect that these children -- and millions of other free thinkers -- have reached voting age.
<P>
<P>Who wants to cast the first stone?
