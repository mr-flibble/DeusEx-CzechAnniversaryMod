<P><JC>UNATCO and the Police
<P>
<P>In carrying out their duties, UNATCO agents often work with other law-enforcement agencies. 
<P>
<P>We remain a small, elite organization.  Until our ranks expand, we must rely on the cooperation of local police, governments, intelligence agencies, and corporate security divisions.  Always be courteous when requesting information or filing an extradition request.  As our jurisdiction widens, we will inevitably experience conflicts with some local officials.  Do not resort to unnecessary intimidation in these situations, and report any problems to the appropriate UNATCO liaison.  Above all, an international law enforcement body requires the RESPECT and SUPPORT of all participating nations.
