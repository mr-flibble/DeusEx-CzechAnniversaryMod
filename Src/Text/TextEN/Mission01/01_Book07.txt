<P><JC>Origins of UNATCO
<P>
<P>In recent years the swelling tide of international terrorism coupled with enmity between states, wildly varying laws, and an anachronistic devotion to arbitrary borders has resulted in the decreasing effectiveness of local law enforcement.  To resolve the problem, a neutral agency was required to enforce international law in an impartial manner around the world.
<P>
<P>UNATCO was formed with just such a mission in mind, an organization that could transcend national boundaries and provide security for all nations that subscribe to its charter.  Founded with the principles of the United Nations as its cornerstone, UNATCO is FAIR, JUST, and protects the individual liberties of all the citizens of the world.
<P>
<P>The criminal thrives on anonymity, but soon there will be no place for them to hide.  Victory over terrorism is the prize for our VIGILANCE.
