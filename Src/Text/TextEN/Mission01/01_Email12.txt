<P>Hey <PLAYERFIRSTNAME>,
<P>
<P>Guess I'll have to get used to calling you "J.C." around the office. Not sure where they came up with that, but at least they gave you the same last codename as your brother.  Anyways, whatever they're calling you, it's good to see a familiar name on the roster.
<P>
<P>My first job here has been to read up on your augmentations.  I'm beginning to see why you found classes so easy.  EVERY NEURON IN YOUR HEAD has been augmented.
<P>
<P>For example: the voice in your head (from an operator, someone here at HQ able to handle the scanning equipment in your skull and broadcast advice over your "infolink") leaps fully formed right into your temporal lobe, bypassing the eardrum and its sensory neurons.  And its perfectly inaudible to everyone around you, of course.  Not to mention that the nanites clinging to your axons can both receive and transmit symbolic information, so if you ever need help, don't sweat it; someone at HQ probably already knows.
<P>
<P>Come by if you want to hear more...this is great stuff...
<P>
<P>Jaime
