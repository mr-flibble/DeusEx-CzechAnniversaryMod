<P><JC>Gray Death: Look to the Sky
<P>
<P>NEW YORK -- No student of recent history can fail to miss the irony that the greatest enemy mankind has faced in the 21st century was not any despot or dictator, but the lowly microbe.  Millions upon millions have been killed by the pandemics of AIDs, resistant tuberculosis, and the Century Flu, and now we face our greatest threat yet: the "Gray Death," a plague of devastating efficiency that has surfaced in the last year.
<P>
<P>But was this plague an accident of nature, or a design of science?  Dr. Kenji Ishii of the New World Biomedical Health Center in New York thinks not.  "My analysis of this plague indicates that it is decidedly unnatural in origin, and in point of fact, may be extraterrestrial." He went on to speculate about those afflicted.  "Obviously, a disproportionate number of the indigent seem to be infected, a situation that makes perfect sense if you consider it prelude to an invasion.  No more effective way to disrupt the social, political, and military fabric of Earth has yet been devised."
<P>
<P>If this is so, then what are our leaders not telling us?  And how can we be prepared?  Only they know they answers. -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer
