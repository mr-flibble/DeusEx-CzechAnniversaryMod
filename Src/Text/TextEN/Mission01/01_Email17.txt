<P><PLAYERNAME> will be joining us today after his stint at the Academy, and I'm assigning the both of you the task of keeping a watchful eye on him while monitoring his progress.  His assigned cover name for the duration of his service will be "J.C. Denton" -- we thought it would be best to keep the cover names within the family since Paul has already received the Denton codename.
<P>
<P>I have great faith in you both, and trust you will do your utmost to insure that he becomes a successful and productive member of this organization.  Until further notice, I'd like to receive weekly reports with your observations.
