<P><B>French Connection Found in Rubble</B>
<P>APR -- New York
<P>
<P>Recently released evidence from last year's bombing of the Statue of Liberty supports growing rumors that link the incident with the French terrorist group "Silhouette."  Already members of Congress are calling for immediate cessation of diplomatic relations between the United States and France unless the responsible parties are brought to justice.
<P>
<P>"Rash accusations will not reverse the damage that has already been done," said UNATCO Director Joseph Manderley.  "Both France and the U.S. subscribe to the UNATCO charter and we are committed to the full and ongoing investigation of this horrible crime."
<P>
<P>An anonymous e-mail received from an individual purporting to be the Silhouette "Minister of True Lies" denies all responsibility.  "For that, you must go to the center of the maze," the e-mail said in part.
