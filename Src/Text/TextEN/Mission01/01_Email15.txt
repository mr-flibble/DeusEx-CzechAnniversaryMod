<P><B>Subject:</B> Nano-Augmentation Stressors
<P>
<P>Nano-augmented agents will often encounter stress created by resentment among fellow agents, particularly those who have been mechanically augmented.
<P>
<P>In an effort to secure freedom and liberty for those under their protection, many UNATCO agents have chosen to sacrifice social acceptance for mission performance by surgically replacing limbs and organs with mechanically or electronically enhanced equivalents. But your nano-augmentations point the way to the future: thousands of microscopic, living, organic machines that exist in symbiosis with your body.
<P>
<P>Because such augmentations create only minimal disfigurement, they are likely to be a source of friction between you and other mechanically augmented agents -- but it is important to understand that UNATCO is an organization where individuals must act in concert.  Each is important to the whole, and mutual understanding is essential to teams comprised of diverse human and augmented agents.
<P>
<P>If you have any further questions or wish to discuss these issues, please feel free to send email to CarverEschells\\UNATCO.4352.768 to make an appointment.  And welcome to UNATCO, agent.
