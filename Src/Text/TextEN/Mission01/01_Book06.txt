<P><JC>UNATCO and the World
<P>
<P>For far too long terrorists have exploited international tensions and regional legislative variations to elude authorities.
<P>
<P>A significant step was made towards eliminating these legal loopholes when U.S. President Philip Riley Mead lobbied the Congress to make the U.S. a UNATCO member nation: "Enough is enough!" he declared in his landmark State of the Union address, and the citizens of the United States responded with enthusiastic endorsement of his position.  Not only did the United States become a charter member of UNATCO, but UNATCO headquarters are now located on Liberty Island in the shadow of that shattered monument to FREEDOM.
<P>
<P>UNATCO deals not only with terrorist threats, but also any transgressions of the international legal code, including drug trafficking, software piracy, and money laundering.  With the full support of the United States, UNATCO was for the first time able to truly declare itself the "WORLD'S POLICEMAN."
