<P>
<P>By now, you've heard about the upcoming transition to nano-augmentation.  It's coming, but not as soon as you think.  UNATCO has only one nano-augmented agent, with a second just now graduating from the Academy.  It will be years before the program leaves the laboratory.
<P>
<P>Your mechanical augmentations are NOT obsolete.  Some agents express concern that they will be "walking junk" in ten years.  One agent expressed their fears in an anonymous e-mail saying "Well be sld at flee markets,. old gray golems for scareing the children.  So what about my legss?  What about my LIFE?"[sic]
<P>
<P>Keep some perspective.  Prosthetics remain the only proven technology for enhancing human abilities.  Those who make the sacrifice are appreciated, commended, and saluted as heroes.
