<P><B>Bootcamp for Betty</B>
<P>APR - Portland
<P>
<P>Madison High School junior Betty Souza will spend the semester at the Canyon City Bootcamp, say school officials.  The crime?  "We have verified that she told another student that she knows how to make a bomb," said Principal Martin Gordly.
<P>
<P>What makes this case notable is that the parents have filed a lawsuit against the school district.  "Our daughter wears black," said father Brandon Souza in a prepared statement.  "She has an occipital jack and we let her use it to play games.  We allowed her to get a tattoo when she turned 16, but none of this makes her a criminal."
<P>
<P>The parents claim that Betty was discussing a novel by Tom Robbins taught at Madison High when the mention of explosives occurred.

<P>Betty Souza will not be alone in Canyon City.  Last year 15,234 young people served sentences in the state's FBI-run "good behavior" camps, a legacy of the Northwest War.
