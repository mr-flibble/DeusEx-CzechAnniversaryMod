<P>To All Staff:
<P>
<P>The recent terrorist attacks on the city and people of New York -- and the subsequent declaration of martial law in an attempt to stem the tide of violence -- has unfortunately created an environment where rumor has supplanted fact as the currency of information.  In an effort to insure that you have the latest, most accurate news, FEMA will be sending you periodic bulletins; only stories officially verified and approved by FEMA should be trusted.
<P>
<P>First and foremost, I can put an end to one rumor and emphatically state that there is <B>NO</B> cure for the "Gray Death" at present.  Government scientists are working day and night to find a treatment, but any stories referencing a secret government cure are outright lies of the most vicious sort.
<P>
<P>Future bulletins will follow.  Please feel free to contact your nearest FEMA or UNATCO representative if you have any further questions.
