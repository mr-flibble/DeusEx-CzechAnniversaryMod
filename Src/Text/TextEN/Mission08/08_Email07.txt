<P>I don't know if this mail will find you or not -- it's been bounced a couple of times off the New York Net, but I keep trying, hoping it's temporary downtime and not something permanent.  There's been an almost total black-out of news from New York City, just talk about terrorists and martial law -- last thing I saw on broadcast was some smuggled footage of these black helicopters and soldiers in riot gear.  It looked like a war.  The President came on and said that it was only temporary, that it was "necessary to protect our way of life," I think that was it... afterwards one of the other grad students here started making plans to move to Lagos, even got a passport.  I began to wonder if he might not have the right idea.

<P>No one can get through to you on the phone, and we're all just hoping you're okay.  As soon as you can, call us or write or do whatever you have to do.  I'll be thinking about you.
