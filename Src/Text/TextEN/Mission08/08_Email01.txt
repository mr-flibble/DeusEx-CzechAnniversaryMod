<P>I found the files you wanted, but I had to obtain them from the Biopreparat data well in Sverdlovsk at great expense.  Strange -- this information wasn't part of any official Biopreparat research effort that I've been able to find, but was conducted under the codename "Velichestvennii" over the last two decades.  There were several other projects attached to the same name being conducted throughout the world, but it was impossible to derive anything from them aside from their existence.  In any case, your buyer must have some fairly esoteric interests.

<P>You'll find my fee debited from your account.
