<P>
<P>As per FEMA Public Health Directive 27 (PHD27), all bodies are to be cremated IMMEDIATELY upon expiration.  To facilitate this process, a new crematorium has been opened in Yankee Stadium; however, citizens are asked not to transport bodies themselves, but to contact the appropriate health officials at EmergencyServices//NYNET.323.4095 if they require assistance.  Failure to comply with any FEMA Directive is punishable by a minimum sentence of 3 years in jail and/or a fine of up to c10,000.
