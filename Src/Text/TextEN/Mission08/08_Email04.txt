<P>I appreciate your update, but I'll be frank with you: the situation is deteriorating faster than you know, and the Board is completely paralyzed.  That 10 million credit donation promised by Page is nowhere to be seen.  Two-thirds of the staff haven't shown up to work in the last few days.  Rumors are starting to surface that there may be a cure for the Gray Death, and what few supply runs we've managed have been attacked by rioters who think we're hoarding it -- the media has been absolutely irresponsible, stirring people up into a frenzy.
<P>
<P>UNATCO troops set up shop here yesterday, calling the whole thing a "peacekeeping occupation" and monitoring all medical traffic: when certain individuals come into any of the clinics for treatment, they're immediately rounded up.  I'm not sure who's running the show anymore.
<P>
<P>If you get this message, do whatever you need to do, up to and including shutting down the clinic.  First priority should be the safety of you and your staff.  I'm not sure how we can help anymore.
<P>
<P>God speed,
<P>Thomas
