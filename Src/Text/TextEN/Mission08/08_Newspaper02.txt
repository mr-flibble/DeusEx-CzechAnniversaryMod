<P><B>Terrorist Bombing Kills 35</B>
<P>APR - Hong Kong, China
<P>
<P>A terrorist attack on the VersaLife building in Hong Kong has at last count left 35 dead and over a 100 wounded.  As authorities continue to search the shattered structure through the early morning hours, the hope for locating any survivors among the remaining missing dwindles.
<P>
<P>VersaLife, a division of Page Industries (NASDAQ:PAGI), has long been on the cutting edge of genetic, biological, and pharmaceutical research, virtually becoming synonymous with treatments for such virulent plagues as AIDS and the Century Flu.  Neither local police nor UNATCO would speculate on possible motives for such an attack, though both confirmed that it was the result of direct terrorist action.  When reached for comment, VersaLife released a short statement saying "We are shocked and saddened by this horrible tragedy, but must turn our attention towards comforting those who have lost a loved one to this senseless violence."
<P>
<P>UNATCO is currently seeking <PLAYERNAME>, a known terrorist, for questioning.
