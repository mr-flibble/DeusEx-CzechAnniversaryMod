<P><B>SOCIETY: Party Against Tomorrow</B>
<P>New York Voice -- Kwesi Dodi
<P>
<P>As the rich flee the city in droves by car and -- horror of horrors, bus (needs must when the devil drives and the airports are closed) -- the rest of us are left to wallow in the empty crypt that has become our city.  The sick and homeless shamble about as if they just left a casting call for "Night of the Living Dead," and the cops obviously came from next door where they're filming a classic 1990's Michael Bay action flick.  Really, the whole thing is too much.  And what does Kwesi recommend when it gets to be too much?  Why party, of course!
<P>
<P>It's not with historical precedent, children.  Those of you without zyme-addled attention spans may remember Boccacio's classic <I>_Decameron_</I> (and that's Boccacio the 14th century writer, and not Boccacio the jungle-thud DJ tripmaster), where a bunch of young, hottie Florentines decided to flee <B>another</B> one of these boring little plagues and hole up with a few too many bottles of wine, tell outrageous stories, and have a go at each other once in a while.
<P>
<P>So, speaking only for Kwesi, I'm going to invite over about 80 of my nearest and dearest -- soon to be nearer and dearer -- with all the food and recreational drugs they can carry, then lock the doors.  Good night, children!
