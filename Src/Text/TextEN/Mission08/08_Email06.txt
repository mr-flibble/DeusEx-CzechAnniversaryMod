<P>
<P>I'm going to talk to the staff individually, but if the riots are as bad tomorrow as they were today then I want you to stay home.  This place is starting to feel a lot like a war zone, only I'm not sure who the enemy is and I'm afraid it might be us.  In any case, I'm going to leave the clinic open -- what few supplies we had have been removed, and the place might at least provide some shelter for those who need it.  If I'm able to make it in tomorrow, I'll tend to those here as best I can.
<P>
<P>Be careful,
<P>
