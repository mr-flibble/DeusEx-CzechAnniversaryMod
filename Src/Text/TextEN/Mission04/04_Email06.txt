<P>Thanks for the e-mail -- sorry I haven't been to reply before now, but we've got our hands full here.  Everyone's working 24 by 7 trying to isolate the Gray Death vectors.  While things haven't been too bad down here in Atlanta (yet), the reports I'm getting back from field operatives in NYC aren't as optimistic.  I'll send you the latest data as soon as I have it, but let me be perfectly honest: the projections aren't good.  Initial casualties could be up to 10% of the current population, with another 3-5% mortally affected by secondary contagions.  If you've got any place to head on vacation, I'd go.  Until then, if any of your people come into contact with this stuff I'd say Level 3 quarantine is your best option.

<P>I've got to run, but I'll let you know as soon as all the data is in --
<P>
<P>Francis
