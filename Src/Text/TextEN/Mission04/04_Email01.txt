<P>
<P>You met me once when doing business with Lebedev; I got the impression you were a professional then, so I'm going to try and handle this professionally now.
<P>
<P>I need passage out of this city -- underneath the official radar -- for me and two other people.  We're prepared to keep our mouths shut, and we're prepared to pay.  We don't care how, and we don't care where: Hong Kong, Lagos, Paris if you can, but anywhere that's outside of the country.  I've hacked this terminal with an account that should be active for the next 24 hours; I'll check it periodically for your response.
<P>
