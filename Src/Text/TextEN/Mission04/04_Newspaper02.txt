<P><B>UNATCO Nabs Terrorists in Hell's Kitchen Raid</B>
<P>APR - New York
<P>
<P>A recent raid on UNATCO's Liberty Island headquarters by members of the National Seccessionist Forces (NSF) ended today when UNATCO troops, working in conjunction with local police, assaulted a warehouse in Hell's Kitchen where NSF units were regrouping.  While UNATCO casualties were low, few NSF members survived the action which UNATCO Director Joseph Manderley termed a "suicidal last stand on their part."
<P>
<P>"We negotiated for hours," said Manderley, "and were prepared to make arrangements for their surrender into custody when an attack was initiated against us by the NSF.  We had no choice but to respond with force.  Obviously, a complete inquiry into this terrible, unfortunate series of events will be undertaken as soon as possible."
