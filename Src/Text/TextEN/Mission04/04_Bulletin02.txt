<P><B>Page Donates to Area Clinics</B>
<P>
<P>Today Bob Page made a record donation of over ten million credits to the Clinics and Hospices Association of New York, the largest private donation in the organization's history.  Already strained to the breaking point by the influx of patients suffering from the "Gray Death," the donation was "a gift from God," according to Ray Cobo, Deputy Director of CHANY.  "This couldn't have come at a better time and should allow us to dramatically improve our services."

<P>"It was the right thing to do," commented Page.  "When I was in New York recently, the suffering that I saw on the streets was unconscionable.  Thomas Aquinas, a personal icon, worked his entire life to ease such terrible pain.  This is the very least I could do."
