<P>
<P>The recent terrorist attack on Liberty Island and the resultant reprisal by UNATCO forces appears to have spilled over onto a private airfield at La Guardia Airport where fighting is still ongoing at last report.  All inbound flights are being rerouted to John F. Kennedy International Airport, while outbound flights have been suspended until further notice.  Look for further updates as more information becomes available.
