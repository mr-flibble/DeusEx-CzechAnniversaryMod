<P>Thank you for bringing this to my attention Dr. Reyes.  If accurate, this mistreatment obviously violates any number of rules in the UNATCO charter and will be thoroughly investigated.  However, the situation is currently very fluid, and I would ask you to refrain from speculating further until we have an opportunity to ascertain all the relevant facts.

<P>>I understand that what we're doing here isn't kid's stuff,
<P>>but I had an NSF trooper brought in to be treated prior to
<P>>interrogation suffering from multiple second-degree burns
<P>>consistent with repeated application of a riot prod at close
<P>>range.  One or two shocks at most should have been enough
<P>>to incapacitate almost any individual; this man had at least
<P>>seven distinct burn wounds.
