<P>
<P>I understand that what we're doing here isn't kid's stuff, but I had an NSF trooper brought in to be treated prior to interrogation suffering from multiple second-degree burns consistent with repeated application of a riot prod at close range.  One or two shocks at most should have been enough to incapacitate almost any individual; this man had at least seven distinct burn wounds.
<P>
<P>This is simply unacceptable, and violates not only the commonly practiced rules of engagement but my own medical ethics.  I understand that this is _not_ indicitive of overall UNATCO policy, and would request that the incident be strenuously investigated and those responsible placed on suspension pending further investigation.
