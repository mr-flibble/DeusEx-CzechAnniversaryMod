<P>Juan, I have a feeling that -- one way or another -- my time here is short, and I think my loyalties are already being questioned.  The inevitable complications from the raid are only going to raise more doubts, so I've pulled together everything I could access without raising additional suspicions.
<P>
<P>Attached you should find information linking Simons, Manderley, and other high-ranking members of UNATCO through covert communications and a series of monetary payments.  If you check the records, over c10,000 a month is being placed into an anonymous Zurich account routinely accessed by Manderley -- the payments were slick, being dispersed through a number of shell companies and orbital banks, but they all eventually originate with companies in which Simons has a controlling interest if you follow the trail far enough back.
<P>
<P>I also managed to document some of UNATCO's less than shining operations, including their role in the Statue bombing.  Most disturbing is further verification of Tracer's suspicion that UNATCO may not only be involved with the distribution of Ambrosia, but also with the Gray Death in some way.
<P>
<P>I've given a copy of all this same material to Jock with orders to deliver it to Tracer if things get as bad as I think they might.  Be careful.
<P>
