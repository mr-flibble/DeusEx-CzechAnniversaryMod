<P><B>Subject:</B> Mission Objectives
<P>
<P>Of primary importance in the upcoming operation is recovering _all_ of the stolen Ambrosia -- if any falls into terrorist hands, it could be a potential tool for blackmail that would pose a serious security risk.
<P>
<P>However, our best intelligence indicates that Juan Lebedev -- a known terrorist leader -- is behind this galling attack; while the loss of the Ambrosia is a regrettable but salvageable incident, Lebedev poses a continuing threat to UNATCO.  He is also a dangerous man, and if the operation should result in his termination rather than capture, there is no doubt that the agent responsible would be found to have acted appropriately and with the full force of the law.
