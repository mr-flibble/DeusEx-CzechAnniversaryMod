<P>Killian showed up with this canister they managed to swipe from Liberty along with the Ambrosia -- handed it off to me, like I'd know what to do with it.  I'll load it onto the plane but then I need to get down to the dock and see what the hell's going on down there.  Juan's not around, so do me a favor and let him know that the suspension crate code for this stuff is 9905 -- maybe he'll know what to do with it.  These other monkeys can't remember their birthdays much less a code.

<P>And tell Younger to get his ass in gear, we're not screwing around out here.
