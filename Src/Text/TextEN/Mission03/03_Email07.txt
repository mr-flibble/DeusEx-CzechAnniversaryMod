<P>Congrats on surviving your first mission, <PLAYERFIRSTNAME>.  I know it's all part of the job, but I'm glad to see you back in one piece (more or less) anyways.  If you get this message before I get a chance to see you in person, then get your ass down here so I can patch you up.
<P>
<P>BTW, I hear a few things from up top and I get the impression that they were definitely taking advantage of this NSF attack to evaluate your performance -- so far, everyone seems to be ecstatic.  Well everyone except for Gunther, but he's got his own problems.  Keep it up, but keep an eye out, too.  I get the impression sometimes that everyone here has their own agenda.
<P>
