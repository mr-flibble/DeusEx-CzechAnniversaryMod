<P>An article recently published in the <I>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</I> indicates that worldwide flooding from melting ice caps will be significantly less this year than in previous years due to an unusually cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere.  Dr. Tammy Bright, a professor of climatology at Oxford University, led the study and noted that global tides should rise by no more than "one to two meters on average" in most major cities throughout North America, Europe, Russia, and East Asia.  For comparison the high water mark in New York last year was four meters, requiring millions of credits in additional spending for a network of levees and pumps.

<P>"While theories concerning the significant increase in days below freezing at either pole abound, the practical upshot is that Arctic ice density has grown substantially when compared to any similar period in the last five years."
