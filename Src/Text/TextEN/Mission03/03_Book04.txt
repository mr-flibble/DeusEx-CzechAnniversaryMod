<P><JC>Chapter 15
<P>
<P>Waiting was always the hardest part: in the stir, and in life.  Guys who couldn't handle it either ended up rocking back and forth in a dark corner, or babbling incoherently.  Always the same.
<P>
<P>Jacob would have been the one rocking in the corner.  He did solitary the first time after a fight, someone thinking he was an easy mark.  Forty-eight hours and he started screaming and didn't stop until his larynx was raw and his voice cracked.  It was a month before he could talk again.
<P>
<P>One of the lifers saw Jacob wasn't as fence-post dumb as the rest of the population and took to schooling him in chess.  Jacob never got much respect from the old-timer, but he got his sanity.  He'd play chess, checkers, backgammon, any game there was.
<P>
<P>He got into another fight when one pendejo who was looking to make a name for himself flipped over Jacob's game board, said impolite things about people and their little kiddie games.  Jacob cracked one of his ribs and amused himself for a week in solitary playing Kasparov and Bobby Fischer in his head.
