<P>Hey Trieste,
<P>
<P>Turns out these "mole" people've got a network of tunnels running all through the city (sewers, abandoned subways, stuff like that, all connected by secret passages) so Juan's apparently worked out some kind of deal with 'em to let us route our supplies underground.  Brooklyn Bridge Station access is through -- get this -- the ladies restroom.  Least they got a sense of humor.  Just for a little added security, I wired up a keypad to the switch -- it's under the sink, code 5482.  Hustle with those generator coils, and check-in when your arrive.
