<P>
<P>I will be arriving at Liberty later today to survey the situation and assess the viability of the primary subject.  Unless there are extenuating circumstances that you've so far failed to present to us, it is our belief that the primary may need to be terminated in favor of the secondary.
<P>
<P>Continue to profile the secondary's response to authority and mission objectives -- if there is any deviation, isolate the subject for debriefing upon my arrival.
