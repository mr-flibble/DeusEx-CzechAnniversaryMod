<P>As ordered, I have maintained a close watch of Agent Denton during our operation in New York.  I have found his performance to be adequate to the task, if not without certain occassional reluctance.  But it is my opinion that nano-augmentations in no way compensate for experience, and Agent Denton quite obviously has a considerable amount of learning to do before he can be considered a fully qualified agent.  Agent Hermann concurs with this evaluation.  I will file a more detailed report when time allows.
