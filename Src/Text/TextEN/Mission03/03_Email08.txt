<P>I don't have much time, so I'm gonna have to cut this short -- they're going to tell you a lot of things about what went on today, and it's probably all going to get pinned on me.  I've got my reasons, but I can't go into them right now -- not over the Net -- but you've got to trust me that there are reasons.  Maybe I can point you in the right direction, tap a few computers and see what you come up with.  Try Manderley's computer if you can risk it, password is "knight_killer".  You might also check Navarre's, but I don't have her password.  Cold woman, be careful around her.  And for that matter, everyone else.
