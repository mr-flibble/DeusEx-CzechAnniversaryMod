<P><JC>Black Helicopters a "Concern" Says Senator
<P>
<P>As sightings of ominous "black helicopters" become increasingly common across the country, from Manhattan to the SoCal shores, many citizens have grown concerned that these gunships are actually a sign that troops may be preparing to mobilize for some unknown action.
<P>
<P>"Certainly this concerns me," said Senator Harry Jarvis (D-Texas), a member of the Armed Services Committee.  "I intend to bring this up in our next committee meeting and ask some hard questions."
<P>
<P>UNATCO Director Joseph Manderley was more skeptical.  "If black helicopters were really being used for 'covert operations,' then those responsible are doing a poor job of it."  Manderley went on to say that UNATCO employed no such aircraft and declined to pursue the matter any further claiming that it detracted from the "serious nature of [our] mission." -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer
